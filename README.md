# Online-Saloon-And-Spa-Booking-System
Salon management system is a web-based salon management application with appointment scheduling functionality. A good way to find out what is happening within a salon is to look at the customer reviews mainly the complaints and how these are dealt with. If there is no log of complaint procedures, it becomes difficult for customers to know more about the salon. It means that the salon isnâ€™t keeping a close eye on the complaint, not dealing with team members who are having the complaints, but also not creating best practice from it.
